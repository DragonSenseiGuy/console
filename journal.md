# Console Game(Week 1)

## January 3rd 2026

I started my project today. Today I made a basic platformer game using a tutorial(first time using godot!). I made the first level in my game(see below)

So I first used the [Jumpstart tutorial](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/godot-platformer) but it got confusing really fast, I spent an hour of *tracked* time on it and had 2 github commits. I scrapped that one and then started following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oED12Mo2018) amazing youtube tutorial. I used assets from [Pixel Adventure](https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/pixel-adventure-1), which was another platformer game. I am thinking of making my own art later this week.

Total time today: 1h 7m(scrapped platformer) + 45m(this new one) =  1h 52m
